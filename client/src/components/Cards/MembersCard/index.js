          From Ontario Tech University:
          <br />
          Anson Tu & Kaushik Ramani conjured up this idea as they thought being
          able to focus on school, instead of having to constantly worry about
          what they could afford to eat and the type of food they were eating is
          a critical factor in academic success.
